	<h1>ENTELODONTIDAE</h1>
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>The family Entelodotidae are related to the ancestors of modern pigs. However these weren't like your ordinary pigs that sit around and do nothing. There is a reason why their nicknames are 'Hell pigs' or 'Terminator pigs'. It had a bite force of upto 2500 pounds per square inch and it was a vicious bone crushing omnivore. It's aggressive behavior could be compared to that of a bear on steroids chasing a deer, which is also on steroids. Entelodonts had full sets of teeth, including large canines, heavy incisors, pointed premolars, and relatively simple flat molars. These features might have been used for defense or offense. In larger species, a bison-like spinal hump supported the weight of the heavy head. The length and proportions of their leg bones are consistent with other hoofed animals that run well on open ground. Like many artiodactyls, they had cloven hooves, with two toes touching the ground, and the remaining two being vestigial. Some entolodonts had bony protrusions on their skulls, which they used to beat the crap out of any unlucky bastard that crossed paths with them. To get an idea of how hardcore these animals are, here is a picture below for refernce.</p>

	<p>Don't be alarmed but it is actually it's happy face.</p>
	<h3>Paleobiology</h3>
	<p>The behaviour of the entelodonts are similar to that of larger land mammals of today. Most of the time it forages for food. Sometimes it rests for a while to admire its surroundings .Then it gets back to beating some unlucky animal ,that was unfortunate enough to piss it off, to death. Which is kind of expected when you mess with somebody whose nickname is hell pig. The extent to which entelodonts were predators is debated, however, wear patterns on entelodont teeth do resemble modern carnivorans in some respects, and the later and larger species have binocular vision. There is also evidence of entelodonts caching the bodies of early camelids as a food source, as well as multiple examples of toothmarks on bones. Entelodonts were among the largest animals in their environments and could easily exploit any available food. If an animal was:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Small or Medium sized</li>
	    <li>Living in the late eocene epoch</li>
	    <li>Living in the same ecological zone as the entelodonts,</li>
	</ol>
	<p>it was screwed.</p>

	<p>Here we see two hell pigs arguing about how they were stupid<br> 
	enough to let a complete stranger sneak away with a portion of<br> 
    their food while they were arguing about how to split the share.<br> 
    Those dumb idiots.</p>
    <p>Just remember ,if a hell pig has targeted you, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Lie down</li>
    	<li>Accept your fate</li>
    	<li>Scream in pain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because no matter how fast you are,<br>
    the hell pig is faster.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Just kidding, they can't kill you. <br>
    Because they are dead. <br>
    Like a really long time ago. <br>
    Can you imagine if they cloned them and put them in theme parks?<br>
    "Welcome to jurassic pork."<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yeah, I did the whole thing just to say that.</p>
